Building things that genuinely help people solve real problems—that's what drives me.

At [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/), I'm working to make technical knowledge more accessible through AI. I've always been drawn to tough engineering challenges and building systems that hold up in practice. My work sits at the intersection of AI and practical engineering, with a focus on creating robust and reliable systems.

## My Journey

My path in engineering started with Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) (with a minor in Computer Science), followed by an MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). 

Along the way, I've worked on a diverse range of projects—from building an autonomous mapping robot (the 2π-Mapper) and developing the main app for [Mood Indigo](https://moodi.org/) festival at IIT Bombay, to reconstructing protein structures with tomographic techniques and working on visualization algorithms at the [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/).

I've been fortunate to learn from incredible people at IIT Bombay, [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and through programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), who have shaped my approach to problem-solving and engineering.

## Current Focus

These days, I'm deep into:
- Building AI systems that help engineers navigate complex technical problems
- Developing robust RAG architectures for production environments
- Creating multi-agent systems that can handle complex workflows (it's fascinating how they can transform tasks like research and financial planning)
- Ensuring AI tools are reliable enough for mission-critical applications

This work has resulted in patents and publications spanning AI systems, network security, and imaging algorithms—which has been incredibly rewarding.

## Beyond the Code

I'm constantly exploring new applications of AI, experimenting with agent orchestration frameworks, and building tools that make everyday tasks easier. Technical competitions and hackathons have been a great way to rapidly prototype and learn new technologies.

Teaching has also been a significant part of my journey. As a TA at UCLA for courses including Neural Networks & Deep Learning, I discovered how much I enjoy making complex topics accessible. During Google Summer of Code, I built a learning platform that now serves thousands of students globally—a project that continues to remind me of the lasting impact good engineering can have.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss practical AI applications, especially around LLMs, agent systems, and building tools that genuinely help people. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about AI, engineering, or anything in between.
