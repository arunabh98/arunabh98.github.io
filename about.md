Hi, I'm Arunabh Ghosh. I love building things that are genuinely useful for real people solving real problems.

I'm currently at Arista Networks, where I'm focused on making technical knowledge more accessible through AI. I've always been drawn to tough engineering challenges and building systems that hold up in practice. My work lies at the intersection of AI and practical engineering, with a focus on creating robust and reliable systems.

## Background

I did my undergrad in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay (with a minor in Computer Science) and then my MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UCLA. My path has led me through a variety of domains—from projects at IIT Bombay like building an autonomous mapping robot (the 2π-Mapper) and developing the main app for Mood Indigo festival, to reconstructing protein structures with tomographic techniques and working on visualization algorithms at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.

I've been fortunate to learn from incredible people at IIT Bombay, EPFL, and through programs like Google Summer of Code, who have shaped my approach to problem-solving and engineering.

## What I'm Working On

These days, my main focus is on:
- Building AI systems that help engineers solve complex technical problems
- Developing robust RAG architectures for production environments
- Creating multi-agent systems that can handle complex workflows (it's fascinating how they can transform tasks like research and financial planning)
- Ensuring AI tools are reliable enough for mission-critical applications

Some of my work has led to patents and publications in areas like network security assessment and tomographic reconstruction algorithms, which has been a rewarding experience.

## Beyond Work

Outside of my day-to-day work, I enjoy exploring new applications of AI, experimenting with agent orchestration frameworks, and building tools for everyday tasks. I've participated in various technical competitions and hackathons over the years, which has been a great way to learn and build interesting projects quickly.

Some of my other experiences include serving as a teaching assistant at UCLA for several courses, including Neural Networks & Deep Learning, which gave me a deep appreciation for explaining complex topics clearly. During my time in Google Summer of Code, I had the chance to build a learning platform that now helps thousands of students globally—a project that still reminds me of the lasting impact good engineering can have.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussing practical AI applications, especially around LLMs, agent systems, and building tools that genuinely help people. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about AI, engineering, or anything in between.
