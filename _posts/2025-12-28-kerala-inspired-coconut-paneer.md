This is one of my favorite paneer curries - creamy coconut with lots of curry leaves and a hint of fennel. It comes together in about 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

**Servings:** 3 (or 4 as part of a larger spread)

### For the Curry Leaf-Coconut Paste:

- 1/2 medium onion, roughly chopped
- 1 medium tomato, roughly chopped
- 15-20 fresh curry leaves
- 1/2 cup grated coconut (fresh or frozen)
- 2-3 tablespoons water (for grinding)

### For the Main Gravy:

- 200g paneer, cubed
- 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 medium tomato, chopped
- 10 fresh curry leaves
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf)
- 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- 2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon oil or ghee, divided
- Salt, to taste
- 1 cup water (adjust for consistency)
- 2-3 tablespoons cream or yogurt (optional; add off-heat)
- Fresh coriander, for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Make the curry leaf-coconut paste:** Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the roughly chopped onion, tomato, and 15-20 curry leaves. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and lightly caramelized. Turn off the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender with grated coconut and 2-3 tablespoons water. Grind to a smooth paste and set aside.

2. **Toast the fennel seeds:** Wipe the pan clean if needed. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil/ghee over medium heat. Add the fennel seeds and let them crackle for a few seconds.

3. **Cook the aromatics:** Add the finely chopped onion and 10 curry leaves. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until the onions turn translucent and light golden. Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

4. **Add tomatoes:** Add the chopped tomato and cook for 3-4 minutes until soft and mushy.

5. **Cook the paste and spices:** Add the curry leaf-coconut paste. Mix well and cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring often, until the mixture smells nutty and the oil starts to separate at the edges. Add turmeric, red chili powder, and coriander powder. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the raw spice smell mellows. Season with salt to taste.

6. **Simmer the curry:** Pour in 1 cup water and bring to a gentle simmer. Adjust water for your preferred consistency.

7. **Add paneer:** Add paneer cubes and simmer for 1-2 minutes only (overcooking can make paneer rubbery). Turn off the heat.

8. **Finish and serve:** If using cream or yogurt, whisk it slightly and stir it in off the heat (avoid adding while the curry is boiling). Sprinkle garam masala on top. Garnish with fresh coriander.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve hot with roti, naan, or paratha
- Pairs well with steamed basmati rice
- Also works as a side with dosa or appam
- Garnish with extra fresh curry leaves for presentation

## Notes

- For the softest paneer, soak the cubes in warm salted water for 10 minutes before adding them to the curry
- Adjust consistency by adding more water for a thinner gravy or simmering longer for a thicker curry
- Fresh or frozen grated coconut works best. If using desiccated coconut, soak it in warm water for 10 minutes before grinding
- For extra richness, use ghee instead of oil
