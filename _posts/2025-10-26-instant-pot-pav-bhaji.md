Pav Bhaji is one of my favorite comfort foods - a spiced, buttery vegetable mash served with soft dinner rolls. This Instant Pot version makes it incredibly easy to prepare at home.

## Ingredients

**Servings:** 4-6

### For the Bhaji:

- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds (optional)
- 3/4 cup onions, finely chopped (125g - 1 medium or 2 small)
- 3/4 cup tomatoes, finely chopped (125g - 2 medium)
- 1 1/2 cups potatoes, diced (300g - 3 medium or 2 large)
- 1/2 cup green peas (75g)
- 1/2 cup carrots, diced (75g - 1 medium)
- 1 cup cauliflower florets (or substitute with 1/2 cup potatoes)
- 1/2 cup bell pepper, chopped (65g - 1 small capsicum)
- 1 tablespoon ginger garlic, finely chopped or paste
- 1 green chili, slit (optional)
- 1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons pav bhaji masala
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder (can add more for heat)
- 2 cups water
- 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
- 2 to 3 tablespoons coriander leaves, chopped

### For Serving:

- 6 to 8 pavs (dinner rolls)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon pav bhaji masala (for toasting)
- 4 tablespoons onions, chopped
- 2 tablespoons coriander leaves, finely chopped
- Lemon wedges

## Instructions

1. **Start sautéing:** Press the SAUTÉ button on the Instant Pot. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil to the steel insert. (Optional: add 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds)

2. **Cook aromatics:** Add onions and green chili. Sauté until the onions become transparent. Spread them in a single layer so they fry quickly.

3. **Add ginger-garlic:** Stir in ginger garlic paste and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. **Add tomatoes:** Add tomatoes, bell pepper, and sprinkle salt. Sauté until the tomatoes turn soft and mushy.

5. **Add spices:** Add pav bhaji masala, red chili powder, and turmeric. Mix well.

6. **Add vegetables:** Add all the vegetables – potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, and peas.

7. **Deglaze:** Pour 2 cups of water and deglaze the pot by scrubbing the bottom with a wooden spatula to remove any stuck bits.

8. **Pressure cook:** Press CANCEL button, then press PRESSURE COOK button with high pressure setting. Set the timer to 5 minutes and turn the steam release handle to the sealing position.

9. **Release pressure:** When the Instant Pot beeps, wait for 5 minutes for natural pressure release. Then carefully release the remaining pressure manually.

10. **Mash vegetables:** With a potato masher or the back of a large spoon, mash all the vegetables well.

11. **Final seasoning:** Press SAUTE button again. Taste and adjust seasonings - add more salt, red chili powder, or pav bhaji masala if needed.

12. **Simmer and thicken:** Let the bhaji simmer for 3-4 minutes until it thickens to the desired consistency.

13. **Finish the bhaji:** Add kasuri methi, stir well, and press CANCEL. Mix in fresh coriander leaves.

14. **Toast the pavs (stovetop method):** Slit each bun horizontally. Heat a pan, add butter, and sprinkle pav bhaji masala over it. Place the buns cut-side down and toast until lightly crisp.

15. **Alternative oven method:** Preheat oven to 240°C (465°F). Spread butter on the cut sides of the pavs, place them on a baking tray butter-side up, and bake for 2-3 minutes, until golden.

16. **Serve:** Transfer bhaji to serving bowls. Top with a small pat of butter and garnish with coriander leaves. Serve hot with toasted pavs, chopped onions, and lemon wedges on the side.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve immediately while hot with butter-toasted pavs
- Garnish with extra butter, chopped onions, and fresh coriander
- Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the bhaji before eating
- Serve with a side of pickled onions or green chutney
- Pair with a cold lassi or masala chai

## Notes

- For a deeper red color, add more Kashmiri red chili powder after pressure cooking
- Make sure to deglaze the pot well before pressure cooking to avoid the "burn" notice
- The bhaji should have a thick but slightly fluid consistency - add a little hot water if it becomes too thick
- For the best flavor, let the bhaji sit for 5-10 minutes after cooking before serving
- You can add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds while tempering for extra flavor
- Vegetables should be mashed to a semi-smooth consistency with some texture remaining
