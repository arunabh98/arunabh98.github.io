I'm Arunabh, a data scientist at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/){:target="_blank"}, where I build AI systems that transform how engineers work with complex technical information.

My focus is on bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and production-ready systems. I develop LLMs that are accurate enough for mission-critical tasks, fast enough for demanding engineers, and robust enough to handle the messy reality of technical documentation.

I earned my MS from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} after my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. My background also includes research at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/){:target="_blank"} in Switzerland and building a global learning platform for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"} that now serves thousands of students.

My experience spans from reconstructing protein structures to developing production AI systems. While this work has led to patents and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mNM6QnkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, I'm most rewarded by building tools that people use to solve real-world problems.

When I'm not building AI, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and writing to make complex topics more accessible. You can also often find me in the kitchen, trying out new recipes.
